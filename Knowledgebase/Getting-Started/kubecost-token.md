Kubecost Token
===============================


The `kubecostToken` field is used to track the status of free trials for paid Kubecost versions. This value can be passed via a helm flag or values file. [View example](https://github.com/kubecost/kubectl-cost#helm-3)

Once a user upgrades to a paid Kubecost tier, a license key is issued and the Kubecost Token becomes irrelevant.
